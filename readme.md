# Ropto frontend test

The test is built to test candidates knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3. Things I'll
be looking for:

* CSS pre-processor (SASS/LESS)
* Gulp configuration (... or webpack/grunt)
* Use of System Fonts
* User experience (hover states, selected states, etc.)
* Code hygiene

Note: the form doesn't have to submit but some dummy AJAX would be nice for some
extra brownie points although this is not a requirement.

You should spend no more than 4 hours on this. Finishing the test is not
important, what is important is how you structure your project and the
readability of your code.
